Task 03: Decision Tree Classifier – Bank Marketing Dataset

📌 Overview
This project involves building a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The analysis is performed using the Bank Marketing Dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

🎯 Objectives
Understand customer behavior using demographic and campaign data
Preprocess and encode categorical features
Build and train a Decision Tree classification model
Evaluate model performance using classification metrics

📂 Dataset
Name: Bank Marketing Dataset
Source: UCI Machine Learning Repository
Description:The dataset contains marketing campaign data of a bank, including:
Age
Job
Marital status
Education
Balance
Contact type
Campaign details
Target variable: Whether the customer subscribed (Yes/No)

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing and unknown values
Encoded categorical variables using label/one-hot encoding
Scaled numerical features where required
Split data into training and testing sets

🤖 Model Building
Algorithm used: Decision Tree Classifier
Library: Scikit-learn
Model trained on customer attributes to predict subscription outcome

📊 Model Evaluation
The model performance was evaluated using:
Accuracy score
Confusion matrix
Classification report (Precision, Recall, F1-Score)

📈 Visualization
Decision Tree structure visualization
Feature importance analysis
These visualizations help understand how the model makes decisions.
